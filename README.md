This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can play the game and enjoy its classic gameplay with a modern interface.

## 📜 Description

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The main objective of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to form a continuous line of three of their own marks (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

### ✨ Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Interactive and responsive design
- Visual indication of the winning combination
- Draw detection

### 🎮 How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 (X) starts by placing their symbol in any of the nine squares.
3. Player 2 (O) follows by placing their symbol in one of the remaining empty squares.
4. Players alternate turns until one player achieves three in a row or all squares are filled.

### 🏆 Winning Combinations

Winning can occur in the following ways:
- Horizontally: Top row, middle row, or bottom row.
- Vertically: Left column, middle column, or right column.
- Diagonally: From top-left to bottom-right or from top-right to bottom-left.

### 🧠 Strategies

- **Offense**: Aim to create multiple opportunities to win (forking).
- **Defense**: Block the opponent's potential winning moves.
- **Center Control**: Occupying the center square provides the best chance for creating a winning line.
- **Corners**: Occupying corners can also lead to strategic advantages.
